Transaction Options (-S, -R, -U):

nodeps: Skips dependency version checks. Package names are still checked.
    Normally, pacman will always check a packageâ€™s dependency fields to
    ensure that all dependencies are installed and there are no package
    conflicts in the system. Specify this option twice to skip all
    dependency checks.

dbonly: Adds/removes the database entry only, leaving all files in place.

Upgrade options (-S, -U):

force: Bypass file conflict checks and overwrite conflicting files.
    If the package that is about to be installed contains files that are
    already installed, this option will cause all those files to be
    overwritten. Using --force will not allow overwriting a directory
    with a file or installing packages with conflicting files and
    directories. This option should be used with care, ideally not at
    all.

needed: Do not reinstall the targets that are already up-to-date

asdeps: Install packages non-explicitly; in other words, fake their install
    reason to be installed as a dependency. This is useful for makepkg
    and other build-from-source tools that need to install dependencies
    before building the package.

asexplicit: Install packages explicitly; in other words, fake their install
    reason to be explicitly installed. This is useful if you want to
    mark a dependency as explicitly installed so it will not be removed
    by the --recursive remove operation.

Remove Options (-R):

cascade: Remove all target packages, as well as all packages that depend
    on one or more target packages. This operation is recursive and must
    be used with care, since it can remove many potentially needed packages.

nosave: Instructs pacman to ignore file backup designations. Normally, when
    a file is removed from the system, the database is checked to see
    if the file should be renamed with a .pacsave extension.

recursive : Remove each target specified including all of their dependencies,
    provided that (A) they are not required by other packages; and (B)
    they were not explicitly installed by the user. This operation is
    recursive and analogous to a backwards --sync operation, and it
    helps keep a clean system without orphans. If you want to omit
    condition (B), pass this option twice.

unneeded: Removes targets that are not required by any other packages.
    This is mostly useful when removing a group without using the -c
    option, to avoid breaking any dependencies.

Sync Options (-S):

downloadonly: Retrieve all packages from the server, but do not
    install/upgrade anything.
